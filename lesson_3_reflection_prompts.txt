When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Yes, its safer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    to prevent conflicts

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clones = complete copy of a git directory, its good when copying a git directory to your computer or your repository
    forks = similar to branch, but contains merged commits
    branches = temporary name for a commit
    

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    a backup stored safely on the cloud, just in case you mess up the local copy or problems due to hardware failure.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    using email, google drive, network share or plain, old sneakernet (flash drives). Github is MUCH easier. Sharing code through flash drives is the hardest.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when trying something new, its better to try on the seperate branch, its lessens the chance of messing things up badly.
