How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Its makes it easier for me to compare two different files. Before I do it manually, now it automatic. its easier to troubleshoot now.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

manually choosing only when to save is far too dangerous to me. far too many external factors (power failures, hard drive failure, etc) can happen, so I usually stick to automatic save. Having something to troubleshoot is better than troubleshooting nothing at all.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is designed for coders, where multiple files are interrelated. While Google docs are designed for single file use.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log helps in tracking what I did on the code i use. and git diff will show me exactly which lines that has changed.
